# Maven_Restaurant_challenge

For the Maven Restaurant Challenge, you will be assuming the role of Lead Analyst at a firm that invests in new restaurant opportunities abroad. After conducting a study to learn about the restaurant market in several Mexican cities, you've been asked to analyze interesting patterns and trends in the data to help understand the market and make investment decisions.

Your task is to share a single-page visual or dashboard that outlines what you'd be looking for in a restaurant to invest in and contains the supporting data from your analysis.
